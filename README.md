# Vacation-Photos
SWIFT project
This Iphone App requests permission to use the phone's photos.
If granted, then the photos from the phone can be loaded.
The App collects the coordinates from the photos and pins them
at that location on the map. 

Currently this works with the one photo in California and 3 photos in Ireland
in the simulator test data. Future version would require a different presentation mechanism
but this illustrates the app is properly functioning with the simulator data.

The map can be scrolled to those locations to see the photos.
To run, build and run in XCode and follow the prompts.
